# docker-node-express-skeleton
A skeleton project that will get you up and running with Node, Express, &amp; ES6 in Docker.

This project will help you get started with using Docker to containerize your Node.js application. I have had some issues finding best practices for this, so I thought I'd collect my opinions here.

**Caveat** This is very opinionated, there are other ways to do this. But, I think this is a best practice.

## Tools Used

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
* [Node.js v4](https://github.com/nodejs/LTS)
* [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/)
* [PM2](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/)
* [Babel.js](http://babeljs.io/)

## Start

* Make sure you have Docker up & running. [Instructions here](https://docs.docker.com/mac/)
* Run `docker-compose up`

## Todos

* Add test framework and tests
